A tool which compares each possible armor combination at each stage of game in Terraria and finds the highest possible combination of stats.

Condenses hours of researching, caculating, and writing down various armor combinations into milliseconds. Suggests multiple viable options and includes info about set bonus and other abilities.

Support for all four main classes, all major game stages, and vanilla or Calamity mod armors.

Future UI will be added along with support for rogue class.
